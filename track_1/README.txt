When solving the first track, the problem of incompatibility of data from different parcellations was clearly discovered, so it was decided to transfer everything to one atlas (Schaefer200). After transferring the data to one atlas and applying two dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, TSNE), the data began to be clearly defined into 2-4 and larger formations. K-means did not reflect the dependence of the data very well and it was decided to use agglomerative clustering. Agglomerative clustering did not identify obvious clusters of 16 pieces, so the clusters were adjusted manually. Based on the open score, there was an attempt to increase the results in public testing.
